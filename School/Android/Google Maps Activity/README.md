In this activity, I learned how to obtain my key to view the map provided by Google for users, as well as how to search for locations through a SearchView with the zoom-in and zoom-out buttons characteristic of Google Maps. I also learned to change the default color of the location marker with the help of a BitmapDescriptorFactory object and to switch the terrain view between a normal view, a terrain view, a satellite view, a null view, and a hybrid view using an Android Studio menu. By doing this activity modularly, I noticed some details that I didnâ€™t consciously understand how to implement before (such as menus); however, as always, practice is necessary so that these details can be replicated in my future projects.
